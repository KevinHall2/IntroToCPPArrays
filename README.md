# IntroToCPPArrays
 
This project contains 6 .exe files that manipulate arrays in C++ in different ways. AIE_01 returns the indexes of a given array in ascending and descending order. AIE_02 gives an array and returns that array's smallest index, highest index, and the amount of times certain values are listed in the array. AIE_03 gives an array, and implements a binary search to find a given value in that array. AIE_04 gives an array, and implements a bubble sort to put the values of the array in ascending order. AIE_05 prints the values of a given array in linear and grid-like format via the use of nested loops and single loops. AIE_06 opens a RayLib window and uses an array and a number randomizer to print a randomized color grid. Left clicking a tile in the grid switches its color.
